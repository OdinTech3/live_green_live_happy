df <- read.csv("data/dataset_sheet1.csv", na.strings = c("", "NA"))

```

Since this dataset represets 1002 individuals lets look at a subset of our dataframe for only individual 1
```{r}
df %>%
  select(Indnum, Group) %>%
  group_by(Indnum) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  count() %>%
  View()
```

```{r}
df %>%
  select(-Group) %>%
  filter(Activity == "Household heating => 70F") %>%
  View(title = "Heating >= 70F")
```

```{r}
transport <- df %>%
  select(-Group) %>%
  filter(Activity == "trips using public ground transportation")

summary(transport[!apply(is.na(transport[,6:15]),1,any),])
```

```{r}
df %>%
  select(Group, Indnum) %>%
  group_by(Group) %>%
  arrange(Group) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  View(title = "indv per group")
```


```{r}

  select(Activity, Indnum, Consumption) %>%
  filter(!is.na(Consumption)) %>%
  group_by(Activity) %>%
  #arrange(Group) %>%
