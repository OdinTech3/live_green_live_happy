```{r}

)

sheet2 <- read_excel(
  "data/dataset.xlsx",
  sheet = "Carbon Footprint",
  range = "A2:N29"
)
```

Below we have a summary of sheet 1 from the excel dataset (excluding sources)

```{r}
sheet1 %>%
  select(-sources) %>%
  summary(sheet1)
```


```{r}
sheet1 %>%
  select(-sources) %>%
  filter(Indnum == 1)
```

# Data Cleaning

# Fill all `NA` values with 0

```{r}
sheet1[is.na(sheet1)] = 0 

sheet1 %>% head()
```

```{r}
sheet2[is.na(sheet2)] = 0 

sheet2
```

Fill in the carbon footprint for each activity

```{r}
for (activity in activities) {
  cf_activity <- as.vector(unlist(sheet2[sheet2$Activity == activity, sources]))
  activity_sources <- sheet1[sheet1$Activity == activity, sources]
  result <- data.frame(mapply(`*`, activity_sources, cf_activity, SIMPLIFY = F)) 
  
  sheet1[sheet1$Activity == activity, sources] <- result
}
```

# Data Preparation

```{r}
sheet1 <- sheet1 %>%
  mutate(TCF = rowSums(.[,sources]))
```


```{r}
head(sheet1)
```


```{r}
write.csv(sheet1, "./data/dataset.csv")
```
